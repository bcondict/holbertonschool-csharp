# 0x08. C# - Inheritance

What you'll find? This part of my Learning process is about:
- What is inheritance
- How is polymorphism achieved with inheritance
- What is a base class
- What is a derived class
- How to create a derived class
- How to override a method or property inherited from the base class
- What is the difference between the override and new modifiers
- What are is, .GetType(), TypeOf(), .IsInstanceOfType(), and .IsSubclassOf() and when to use them

Here are the task I solve to answer those question and more. The solution to every task is on the file with the same name than the task.

My challenge for you is to try to solve all of this task and after see the way I did it.

There are some task that may need a main file, all the main code would be in main directory, it must be at the same directory of the task to work properly.

To run a specific task run dotnet run inside of the task directory.

All of this code was me on .NET version 2.1, asked for Holberton School.

#### 0. This is one of these
Write a method that returns True if the object is an int, otherwise return False.
- Class: `Obj`
- Prototype: `public static bool IsOfTypeInt(object obj)`
